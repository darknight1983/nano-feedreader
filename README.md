# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


## Running The Project

1. Run the project in the browser using your favorite server or by opening the index.html file.

2. Be sure to take a look at [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) documentation to get an overview of how tests are written using this tool.

3. After reading over feedreader.js, make changes that will cause the tests to fail. This will help you to understand how the tests are written.
